Built a hybrid method consisting of the Ensemble learning technique Stacking along with Oversampling method SMOTE on five datasets having the class imbalance problem. Datasets extracted from different sources like Kaggle, UCI, etc. Three different algorithms of Machine Learning: SVM, KNN and NB are used for classification.
